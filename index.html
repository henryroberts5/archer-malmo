  <p>The Bartlett High School Website Design classes took a field trip to Archer Malmo in Memphis, TN. Archer Malmo is a place where professional Website people make websites. During the school day, we went to first and second period. At the conclusion of second period, we dropped off our backpacks in Mrs. Sinclair's room and gathered in the main lobby. Then we got on the bus and the bus took us to our destination in Downtown Memphis.</p>
  
  <p>On the way to Archer Malmo, I played on my phone on the bus. Close to the time that we got there, our bus got a flat tire. After we went inside, someeone whose name I do not remember(maybe Bob?) took us up to the fifth floor of the building via the elevator. We had to go up in multiple shifts because the elevator can only hold a certain number of people and there were over fourty people on our field trip.</p>

  <p>Once all of us were on the fifth floor, some of the employees who worked there talked to us about what it would be like to work at Archer Malmo. There were three people that talked to us on the fourth floor. They all told us there different stories of how they got to Archer Malmo and became interested in Web Design. After that, they answered all of our questions that we had typed up a couple of days before we went to Archer Malmo.</p>

  <p>The first question that they answered was mine. I asked them what the specific steps when they made website were. They said that it takes a few months to actually deal with the client before they can start the designing process. This took a long amount of time because there were three people going into detail about every question. In total, the presentation took about two hours.</p>

  <p>After they finished answering our questions, the employees showed us around the building. The most interesting part was the basement where they do photography. It was in the basement because the sunlight can't interfere with the pictures. After the tour was over, we got on the bus and went to The Cookout for lunch. I ate chicken strips for lunch at a table with Nick Honnaker. The Cookout was a good restaurant. After we ate, we came back to school and waited for the end of the day.</p>
